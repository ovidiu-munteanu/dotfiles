# dotfiles
A set of dotfiles that I put together to customize my bash experience.

I wrote many of the things in these files but I also had many sources of
inspiration. As I do not remember every single one of them I would like to
thank everyone who generously share their work on GitHub and everywhere else so
others can also benefit from it. 

## Installation & Usage
### Linux
Running `install` should pretty much take care of things for you.

_**NOTE:**_ I only use these in Ubuntu 18.04 and CentOS 6 and I do not know if
they work in other versions/distributions.  

### Git Bash for Windows
I also use these dotfiles with Git Bash for Windows, but you have to install them
manually by either copying or symlinking them into the root of your user folder.

_**NOTE:**_ I only use these in Windows 10 and I do not know if they work on
older version of Windows, in particular when it comes to symlinks.

### Windows Subsystem for Linux
These dofiles also work in the Windows Subsystem for Linux. So far, I only used
them in the Ubuntu distribution. As with regular Linux distributions, running
`install` should take care of everything.

### Other OSes
Apart from the systems listed above, I did not test these dotfiles on any other
OSes. However, I see no reason why they would not work on a variety of Linux
compatible systems.
